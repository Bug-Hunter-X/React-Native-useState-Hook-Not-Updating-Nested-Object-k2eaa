This error occurs when using the `useState` hook in React Native with a nested object.  If you try to update only a part of the nested object directly, React Native won't re-render the component as expected. This is because React's shallow comparison only checks the references of objects.  If the reference of the nested object remains the same even after a modification, React doesn't detect the change.
